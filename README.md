# Multiplex key roles to Disrupt Criminal Networks
From a huge database collected by the security intelligence of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, we propose a protocol to analyze organized crime as a network of collaborative individuals, exposing its underlying structure as a multiplex network. We propose a protocol to identify and classify key agents through diversity analysis in multiplex networks. Based on this classification, different strategies for identify key roles and disrupt the network into a multilayer structure are compared. We measured the performance of eleven different identification strategies and showed that the proposed key-agent definition based on the diversity measure is the most efficient.
Here can find data from the crime network and the algorithms used.
